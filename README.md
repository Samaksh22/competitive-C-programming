# Working on C Programming
As the name suggests..

## Personal Strings Library
*Jan 12 2026*
- Working on my own simple C strings library. Hope to use it in my competitive programming (maybe). But doing it for that purpose.
- Some of the things to remember are:
  - All `str` values must be created by this API
  - Using `str` after `str_drop` is undefined behavior
  - Functions do not check for invalid strings
  - Simplicity over Defesive checks
